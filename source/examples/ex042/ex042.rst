In this example we demonstrate how one can use combine Cartesian data for
Antarctica (here the BEDMAP data already projected via a stereographic projection)
with geographic data, all using the same map scale. It also shows how one would set up
minor legends and map scales.

.. literalinclude:: ./ex042.sh
   :language: bash

.. figure:: ./ex042.*
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Illustrate plotting of Antarctica with Stereographic Data.
