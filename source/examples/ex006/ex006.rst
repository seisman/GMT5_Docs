(6) 统计直方图
--------------

GMT provides two tools to render histograms:
:doc:`pshistogram </pshistogram>` and :doc:`psrose </psrose>`. The former takes care of
regular histograms whereas the latter deals with polar histograms (rose
diagrams, sector diagrams, and wind rose diagrams). We will show an
example that involves both programs. The file ``fractures.yx`` contains a compilation of
fracture lengths and directions as digitized from geological maps. The
file ``v3206.t`` contains all the bathymetry measurements from *Vema* cruise 3206.
Our complete figure was made running
this script:

.. literalinclude:: ./ex006.sh
   :language: bash

.. figure:: ./ex006.*

   Two kinds of histograms.
