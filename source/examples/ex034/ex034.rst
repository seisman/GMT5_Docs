(34) 用国界线约束绘图
---------------------

The script produces the plot in Figure. Here
we demonstrate how :doc:`pscoast </pscoast>` can be used to extract
and plot country polygons.  We show two panels; one in which we do
a basic basemap and another where we lay down a color topography
image and then place a transparent layer identifying the future
Franco-Italian Union whose untimely breakup in 2045 the historians
will continue to debate for some time.
